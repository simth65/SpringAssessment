Spring Boot Assessment
1. What did you like about this project?
This assessment is quite real although it is a strip down version of a system. Several other functions are not there but the focus was on retrieving and saving records into the database.
2. What did you struggle with in this project?
I found this assessment quite tough. It was difficult to understand Spring Boot. Had to use the Tasks taught in class to tackle this project step by step.
3. What would make your experience with this assessment better?
Spring Boot is a large but complex topic. More time should be given to cover the lessons. How Spring Boot works is still very magical to me. I doubt I can solve any problem if they occur out of what was taught in class.
